#Fermat's Little Theorem

Consider the set of all bracelets consisting of p beads each of one of a different colours i.e. elements of {1,â€¦,a}^p. Consider the equivalence relation that says 2 bracelets are equivalent if one can be reached from the other by a cyclic shift operator (i.e. the bracelets are the same up to the beads moving round in an order preserving fashion). The equivalence classes consist of the a singleton sets of the monotone bracelets (i.e. the constant vectors) and some number of (say k) sets of size p. Therefore a^p=kp+a QED
