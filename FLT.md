# Fermat's Little Theorem

Let *G* be the cyclyc group of order *n* and let *x* be a generic element.

Let **ord(x)=k**. Them the subgroup generated by *x*, call it *H* trivially has order *k*.

By Lagrange's Theorem **ord(H) | ord (G)**

so **k|n**

## Lagrange's Theorem
  If *G* is a finite group and *H* is a subgroup then
              **|H|||G|**
              
              
### Proof
  
 We define an equivalence relation on elements of *G* given by 
  
 *xâ‰ˆy* if *x-y \in H*. Check that this is an equivalence relation. The equivalence classes are called *cosets* and are denoted by 
 
 **x+H**
 
 Clearly, if *h* and *k* are elements of *H* then *x+h = x+k* implies *h=k* hence the elements in *x+H* are in bijection with the elements of *H*
 
 Thus, the cosets partition *G* and each member of the partition has the same cardinality, equal to the order of *H*
